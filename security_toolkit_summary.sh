echo "⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:"
echo ""
echo "🔧 REQUIREMENTS:"
echo "   - Root access for full functionality"
echo "   - iptables for firewall rules"
echo "   - Basic networking tools (netstat, ss, etc.)"
echo ""
echo "🛡️ SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:"
echo "   - Always test rules in safe environment first"
echo "   - Keep backups of network configurations"
echo "   - Monitor logs regularly"
echo "   - Update systems and tools frequently"
echo "   - Use layered security approach"
echo ""
echo "⚡ PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:"
echo "   - Monitoring tools use minimal resources"
echo "   - Large rule sets may impact performance"
echo "   - Log files can grow - implement rotation"
echo "   - Test alert thresholds for your environment"
echo ""
