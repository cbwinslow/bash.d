# Contributing to the Multi-Agent Collaboration System

We welcome contributions to this project! Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth development process.

## Branching Strategy

We use a simplified GitFlow branching model:
- `main`: This branch represents the latest stable release. All development should be done in feature branches.
- `feature/<feature-name>`: Create a new branch from `main` for each new feature or bug fix. Example: `feature/add-github-search-tool`.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure your code adheres to the coding standards (see `pyproject.toml` for linter and formatter settings).
2.  Make sure all tests pass (`pytest`).
3.  Create a pull request from your feature branch to the `main` branch.
4.  Provide a clear title and description for your pull request, explaining the "what" and "why" of your changes.
5.  At least one other developer must review and approve the pull request before it can be merged.
