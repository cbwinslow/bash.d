# AI Agent Guidelines

This file provides guidance for AI agents interacting with the `bash.d` ecosystem.

## Purpose

The `bash.d` repository is designed to be understood and navigated by AI agents. Each directory contains an `agents.md` file (like this one) to provide context and instructions.

## Directory Context

**This directory is part of a larger project.** To understand its purpose, you should examine the `README.md` file in this directory (if it exists) and the files in the parent directory.

Key files to look for:
- `README.md`: Describes the contents and purpose of the directory.
- `*.sh`: Shell scripts that contain the core logic.
- `package.yaml`: Project-level dependencies and metadata.
- `docs/`: Project-level documentation.

## Agent Instructions

- **Be Cautious:** Do not execute any scripts without first understanding their purpose and potential side effects.
- **Read First:** Before making any changes, read the relevant documentation and source code.
- **Follow the Rules:** Adhere to the conventions and standards defined in `docs/rules.md`.
- **Stay Organized:** When adding new files, ensure they follow the established naming conventions and directory structure.

## Goal

Your goal is to assist with the development, maintenance, and operation of the `bash.d` platform. By following these guidelines, you can become a productive and reliable contributor to the ecosystem.
