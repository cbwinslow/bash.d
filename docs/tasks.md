# Tasks & Short-Term Work

This document captures small-to-medium sized tasks that contributors can pick up quickly.

## How to use
- Keep tasks scoped and actionable.
- Prefer single-file or single-feature fixes for newcomers.
- Add estimated effort and a short description.

## Example Tasks
- Add unit tests to `src/` functions that lack coverage
- Implement pagination for `data/` connectors
- Improve logging in `platform/blog_engine.sh`
- Create a basic smoke test for `./bashd setup`
- Harden the `scripts/setup.sh` install path for idempotency

## Current Open Tasks (from roadmap.md)
See `docs/roadmap.md` for high-level priorities and ongoing project phases.

## How to claim a task
- Open an issue and reference the task here
- Push a short-lived branch and create a PR
- Add a short note to `master_todo.md` when you start
