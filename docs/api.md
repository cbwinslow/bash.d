# API Reference — bash.d

This is a high-level placeholder for API docs. Concrete endpoints should be added as they are implemented.

## Expected endpoints (examples)
- GET /api/v1/content — list content items
- GET /api/v1/content/:id — single content item
- POST /api/v1/data/sync — trigger data synchronization
- GET /api/v1/search?q=:query — search index

## Documentation notes
- Document request/response formats and examples
- Note pagination, authentication and rate limiting
- Provide error codes and examples

## Automation
- Consider adding auto-generated OpenAPI specs from running services
- Use API docs to generate client SDKs and tests
