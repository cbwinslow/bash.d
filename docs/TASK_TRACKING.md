## 🔗 Cross-Reference System

### Task ID Format:
- **MASTER-X.Y.Z:** Tasks from MASTER_TASK_LIST.md
- **TASKS-X:** Tasks from docs/tasks.md
- **SPRINT-X:** Ad-hoc sprint tasks

### Dependency Notation:
```
Task A → Task B  (B depends on A)
Task C ⇄ Task D  (C and D are mutually dependent)
Task E || Task F (E and F can be done in parallel)
```

### Example Cross-References:
```
MASTER-3.1.1 → MASTER-3.1.2 (Agent registry needs base schema)
MASTER-1.1.3 ⇄ MASTER-1.2.1 (Completions and aliases reference each other)
MASTER-1.4.1 || MASTER-1.5.1 (History and prompts independent)
```
