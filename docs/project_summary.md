# Project Summary — bash.d

## Overview
bash.d is an enterprise-grade development ecosystem and CLI toolchain that integrates data ingestion, infrastructure, tooling, and AI-powered automation. It’s designed to make it simple to build, deploy and operate data-driven applications, particularly those that need to gather, analyze, and publish public data sources.

## Goals
- Provide a single, modular CLI (`bashd`) for managing platform lifecycle (developer tools, content, data ingestion, deployments).
- Make government and public datasets accessible, searchable, and reusable.
- Offer an extensible plugin architecture for integrations and AI agents.
- Maintain strong security and automation-first practices.

## Audience
- Platform operators and DevOps engineers
- Data engineers and analysts
- Application developers and integrators
- Contributors interested in public data and civic tech

## Status
This repo is actively developed; core scaffolding and directory structure are present. Next priorities include implementing additional connectors and documenting the system’s architecture and operational playbooks.

## Getting Started
